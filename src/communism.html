thoughts on communism (even though capitalism sucks too)</h1>
<p>I was in the shower recently thinking about communism.</p>
<p>The question isn’t whether communism is appealing as a concept. Many
of its goals around equality and meeting human needs are admirable. The
question is whether it can actually function at the scale of a nation,
particularly one as large and diverse as the United States. The answer,
when examining practical constraints rather than ideological
preferences, appears to be no.</p>
<p>Communism might work in small communities where people know each
other, share values, and can coordinate effectively. But scaling to
millions or hundreds of millions of people introduces fundamental
organizational challenges.</p>
<p>Systems requiring high trust and shared values function better when
people actually know each other. At the scale of millions, you need
entirely different organizational structures.</p>
<p>Centralized systems struggle with the information problem.
Decision-makers are far removed from local conditions and lack the
distributed information that even imperfect market signals provide.
Though it’s worth noting that large capitalist systems face their own
coordination failures. The 2008 financial crisis was a massive
information and coordination breakdown in a supposedly efficient market
system. Scale introduces complexity for any economic model, not just
communist ones.</p>
<p>Small, relatively homogeneous populations can build consensus on what
“fair” looks like more easily. Consider the Nordic countries, though
calling them simply “capitalist” oversimplifies things. They have
significant state ownership, unions with real power over corporate
decisions, and different property relations than pure market capitalism.
They’re more accurately described as hybrid systems, demonstrating that
the spectrum between capitalism and socialism isn’t binary. But even
these systems, operating at 5-10 million people, face challenges.
Scaling to the United States with 335 million people spread across
vastly different regions with different priorities makes the complexity
explode exponentially.</p>
<p>Communism assumes a world of relative abundance where the main issue
is distribution. But what happens during actual scarcity, real famine,
economic collapse, crisis? Someone, somewhere, has to make impossible
choices about who gets what.</p>
<p>Imagine: a starving single mother with three kids (including a
newborn) and a single father with two kids. You have limited food. Who
do you prioritize? The larger family? Do you factor in that the newborn
has no self-awareness or memories yet? There’s no objectively correct
answer, only tragic trade-offs.</p>
<p>Centralized systems are particularly dangerous for handling these
decisions, not because distributed systems avoid the moral horror, but
because of where the responsibility concentrates:</p>
<p>In a centralized system, someone (or some committee) has to literally
decide: “these people get food, those people don’t.” They’re actively
choosing who lives and who dies. That’s the trolley problem made real
and you’re forced to pull a lever. Decision-makers are removed from
local realities, power concentration makes the system vulnerable to both
corruption and ideological rigidity, and with no objective moral
standard to constrain them, this concentrated authority becomes
extraordinarily dangerous. Historical examples—Stalin’s policies during
the Holodomor, Mao’s Great Leap Forward—show how catastrophically wrong
this can go.</p>
<p>In a market system during famine, people starve because they can’t
afford food, but no single person made that specific choice about who
dies. It’s an emergent outcome of millions of distributed decisions. The
moral horror is diffused across the system rather than concentrated in
specific decision-makers. This doesn’t make the deaths less real or the
suffering less terrible. People still die, children still starve, and
it’s arguably worse because the diffusion of responsibility means no one
feels accountable. It obscures the fact that these are still
choices—policy choices, economic choices—and lets people off the hook
morally (“the market decided, not me”).</p>
<p>But the mechanism of suffering matters, not just the amount. One type
of bad (concentrated moral authority with life-and-death power) creates
different failure modes than another type of bad (diffused negligence
where everyone can claim it wasn’t their choice). Capitalist famines
have killed millions too—Bengal 1943, the Irish potato famine where food
exports continued while people starved. The question isn’t which system
avoids moral catastrophe, but which failure mode is less likely to
produce the worst outcomes given human fallibility and the absence of
objective moral foundations.</p>
<p>Even most communist theory doesn’t eliminate money entirely in the
near term. Historically, communist states used currency and wages, just
with state control. But this creates murky questions: who controls how
money is made and distributed? How are taxes collected and allocated?
How do people acquire personal belongings beyond basic necessities?</p>
<p>The answer typically becomes: centralized state bureaucracy. This
introduces massive inefficiency and corruption opportunities. Any system
must be robust to bad actors. Calling this “human nature” is
philosophically contested—what we call human nature is partly shaped by
the systems we live in, and people do behave differently in different
economic contexts. But the practical point stands: assuming universal
honesty and virtue is a fantasy. Free will exists, and humans will game
whatever system you create.</p>
<p>Communist systems rely heavily on good faith: how do they verify
you’re not lying about your assets to receive more? Who ensures the
distributors aren’t corrupt? What prevents those with power from abusing
it? History shows these aren’t hypothetical concerns. Systems need
mechanisms that work even when people are selfish, dishonest, or
corrupt.</p>
<p>Centralized systems can innovate. The Soviet space program, nuclear
weapons development, and current Chinese technological advancement prove
this definitively. The internet itself emerged partly from DARPA,
government funding driving fundamental research. China’s current system
(state capitalism with heavy central planning) is producing substantial
innovation in AI, green energy, and infrastructure.</p>
<p>The relationship between economic systems and innovation is complex.
Market competition drives a particular kind of rapid consumer
innovation—computers, smartphones, the variety of products we take for
granted emerged largely from capitalist systems with their complex
payment and delivery mechanisms. But centralized systems excel at
coordinated, long-term projects with unclear immediate returns: space
programs, fundamental research, massive infrastructure. The Soviet Union
went from agrarian society to space power in four decades.</p>
<p>The question isn’t “which system innovates?” but “what kind of
innovation, under what circumstances, and at what cost?” Markets
incentivize incremental consumer innovation but underprovide public
goods and long-term research. Centralized planning can achieve massive
coordinated projects but often misses decentralized needs and evolving
preferences. Both models have demonstrated innovation capacity; both
have characteristic blind spots.</p>
<p>Markets do aggregate information through price signals, but they also
produce systematic failures that aren’t just policy mistakes to be
fixed: externalities (pollution, climate change), public goods problems
(infrastructure, basic research), information asymmetries (healthcare,
financial products), boom-bust cycles, monopolistic behavior. These
aren’t edge cases, they’re fundamental features of how markets work.</p>
<p>Wealth inequality isn’t just about lack of redistribution; it’s baked
into how capital accumulation functions. Healthcare can’t work as a pure
market because you can’t shop around while having a heart attack, and
insurance companies profit by denying care. Housing markets lock people
out not through individual moral failures but through structural
dynamics of property as investment.</p>
<p>Many complaints about “capitalism” are really about lack of
regulation, weak labor protections, or specific political
choice—problems that could theoretically be addressed through reforms.
But some problems are more fundamental to treating human needs (housing,
healthcare, education) as commodities subject to profit-seeking.</p>
<p>Every large-scale communist attempt ended in some combination of:
economic failure, famine (sometimes with cannibalism during the worst
periods), authoritarian repression, collapse. The Soviet Union, Maoist
China, the Khmer Rouge—these aren’t abstract failures. They’re
documented catastrophes.</p>
<p>But if we’re evaluating systems by their worst implementations,
capitalism also has famines (Bengal, Ireland), authoritarian
implementations (Pinochet’s Chile), and catastrophic failures. The
question becomes whether the bad outcomes were inherent to the system or
contingent on other factors, and that’s genuinely hard to determine.</p>
<p>The crucial question I don’t fully answer: why did revolutionary
communist transitions become authoritarian? Is it inherent to attempting
communism, or inherent to revolutionary change in general? Is it about
the economic system, or about seizing state power through violence?
That’s a crucial distinction.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that my critique mostly addresses centrally
planned economies (the USSR model). But there are other
traditions—anarcho-communism, council communism, market socialism,
cooperative economics—that don’t rely on central planning. The critique
of central planning may not apply equally to all variants of communist
thought.</p>
<p>Even so, the historical reality creates a massive political obstacle.
This isn’t just irrational propaganda backed by abstract fears, it’s
backed by actual documented events. Even if you argue “that wasn’t real
communism” or “authoritarianism was the problem, not the economic
system,” you’re asking people to trust that this time will be different.
That’s an incredibly hard sell.</p>
<p>This is different from fighting prejudices like racism or homophobia.
Those are hatreds of people for existing. Resistance to communism is
resistance to a system with a track record. The perception problem has a
foundation in reality, not just bias.</p>
<p>For the United States specifically, you’d face: decades of Cold War
cultural conditioning, a national identity built around individualism
and entrepreneurship, many citizens who fled communist regimes and have
personal reasons for opposition, and powerful economic interests with
every incentive to resist.</p>
<p>Implementing communism in any way other than by force is simply
impossible. And force would introduce catastrophic problems of its own.
Even if 51% of people voted for communism tomorrow, how would you
actually transform an economy that size without massive disruption? Who
loses their assets and how? How do you prevent capital flight? What
happens during the chaotic transition period? How do you maintain basic
services while restructuring everything?</p>
<p>Revolutionary upheaval at the scale of a nation-state is
extraordinarily risky. You’re not just changing policy; you’re trying to
coordinate massive transformation across a continent-sized
population.</p>
<p>Much of what people hate about capitalism is actually about specific
policy failures that exist in some capitalist countries but not others:
healthcare access problems in the US (other capitalist countries provide
universal healthcare effectively), corruption in government contracts
(happens under any economic system), extreme wealth inequality (could be
addressed through taxation and redistribution without abolishing
markets).</p>
<p>These could potentially be addressed through reforms rather than
revolution. But that requires honestly distinguishing between problems
inherent to markets and problems that are policy choices.</p>
<p>There is no economic system that can fix everything. Anyone who says
otherwise is lying.</p>
<p>Capitalism sucks at: wealth inequality, leaving people behind,
treating healthcare as a commodity, boom-bust cycles, environmental
destruction for profit, systematic power imbalances between capital and
labor.</p>
<p>Communism (as implemented) sucks at: innovation incentives in
consumer goods, efficiency, personal freedom, resisting authoritarian
drift, handling scarcity, preventing power abuse.</p>
<p>Social democracies suck at: being expensive, requiring high trust and
cohesion, sometimes stifling growth, and still not eliminating
capitalism’s problems, just mitigating them.</p>
<p>The question isn’t “which system is perfect?” It’s “which problems
can we actually handle, and which ones hurt the most people the worst?”
That varies by context, culture, size, and resources.</p>
<p>When I say “there is no objective right and wrong,” I’m not arguing
for nihilistic relativism where all choices are equally valid. Decisions
still have to be made. Resources must be allocated. During scarcity,
someone eats and someone doesn’t.</p>
<p>What I mean is: there’s no cosmic answer key for complex moral and
political questions, no objective foundation we can point to that
definitively proves “this is the right way to organize an economy” or
“this person deserves food more than that person.”</p>
<p>This matters enormously for WHERE moral authority gets
concentrated:</p>
<p>In centralized systems, a committee must explicitly decide moral
questions (“who gets food?”), articulate criteria and apply them to
millions of people, and construct and enforce what counts as “right”
across an entire nation. With no objective standard to check them, this
concentrated power becomes extremely dangerous. Stalin and Mao weren’t
just bad people, they had concentrated power to enforce their moral
vision without effective constraints or feedback mechanisms.</p>
<p>In distributed systems, moral judgments emerge from millions of
individual decisions within constraints. No single entity declares “this
is the right allocation.” The outcomes still reflect values (property
rights, market rules) and can be horrible, but there’s no single point
of moral authority that can impose their vision by force. Power is
diffused, which limits how catastrophically wrong any single moral
judgment can go.</p>
<p>Given moral uncertainty plus human fallibility plus power corruption,
distributed decision-making is less likely to produce catastrophic
outcomes than centralized decision-making, even if both produce
significant suffering.</p>
<p>This isn’t “everything is relative so nothing matters.” It’s “because
there’s no objective foundation, concentrating moral decision-making
power is especially dangerous.”</p>
<p>We can still make evidence-based judgments about what reduces
suffering. We can still say some systems work better than others in
specific contexts. We can distinguish between better and worse outcomes
based on measurable impacts. But we should maintain humility about our
certainty and be extremely cautious about giving anyone the power to
enforce their moral vision on millions of people.</p>
<p>Communism at the scale of a modern nation-state faces insurmountable
practical problems: scale (though this affects all large systems), human
behavior (though what counts as “nature” versus learned is contested),
implementation challenges, historical stigma, and the fundamental
challenge of making tragic choices under scarcity without concentrating
dangerous amounts of moral authority.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean capitalism is perfect or that we shouldn’t pursue
reforms. Strong social safety nets, universal healthcare, worker
protections, progressive taxation—these are all possible within market
economies, as demonstrated by various countries. Some problems
attributed to capitalism are really policy choices that could be
different.</p>
<p>The goal should be reducing suffering and building systems that suck
less, not chasing ideological purity. That requires accepting
trade-offs, staying humble about our certainty, and being honest about
what actually works rather than what we wish would work.</p>
<p>It’s not right. It’s not good. But in a way, nothing is. We’re all
just making decisions in a universe that doesn’t come with an answer
key, trying to choose options that lead to less suffering rather than
more. And maybe that’s the best it’s the best we can do.</p>

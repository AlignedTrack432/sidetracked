        <p>I will be moving from my apartment within the next year. I’ve lived
here since 2020. Hardly an amazing place. But it works. There are paper
thorns all over the garden. God I remember the first day where I stepped
on a massive bush of them. Anyway, I started thinking, I want to plant
some fruit at this undetermined new place. I started thinking about
figs, but they grow on trees, which is a bit too permanent and major for
a shared apartment yard. I’ve always wanted to grow an apple tree, but I
nearly never stay at a place for more than 5 years, for various reasons.
The thought hit me of planting something like an apple tree, in a place
I’m about to move out of, those can take 10 years to bear. It’s an
interesting thought experiment, anonymous delayed altruism with zero
guarantee of payoff and high chance of waste, helping a stranger I don’t
know, and will never meet. They could abuse and kill the tree, or it
could grow and fruit for years to come. I won’t be there to reap any
rewards. It is a rather pure form of altruism, giving where there’s zero
personal gain, not even recognition. It strips altruism down to its
essence, doing something good with no strings attached, not even the
knowledge of whether it worked. “This will produce [fruit/herb] in
[timeframe]. Water when soil is dry. Enjoy.” No name, no expectation of
thanks. It’s also a test of self governance, sorta like the shopping
cart theory, no one will come after you if you don’t water the tree, but
it doesn’t take much to care for the tree, if you keep it going, it will
prosper, and you’ll almost certainly be happy, but it is work, you could
just kill the tree, save the work. It would be wasting someone else’s
multi year commitment, but who cares? Why plant it if you’re not going
to be able to reap it? Will you continue something someone else started
for you, even though they’ll never know? The tree might thrive, might
die. You’re just increasing the probability that something good exists
in the world. Helping a stranger you don’t know, and will never meet.
It’s interesting because most “altruism” has some kind of feedback
mechanism: donate to charity &gt; tax receipt, good feeling, maybe
recognition help a neighbor &gt; they might help you back, social
capital volunteer &gt; meet people, resume line, visible impact But
leaving a fruiting plant for an unknown future tenant is severed from
all typical reward structures. You will never know, if they even
noticed, if they kept it alive, if they appreciated it or thought you
were weird, if they got years of fruit from it. There’s something almost
absurd about it. Stupid. You’re investing time and money into benefiting
a person who is currently a void in your knowledge, they don’t exist to
you in any concrete sense. They might be someone you’d hate if you met
them. They might be someone who kills plants and punches infants for
fun. And yet the act still means something to you in the doing of it.
The meaning exists in the gesture itself, not in any outcome. And also,
what happens, if nothing does? If the seed just dies in the ground, and
has no effect. You haven’t done anything, so do you deserve the credit
for this altruistic act? Have I done any good at all? Do I deserve
credit? In my heart I may have wanted to do good, and I did all I could,
but in the end, I didn’t. If the seed dies and nothing happens, you’ve
produced zero good in the world. The outcome is what matters. You wasted
resources (seed, effort, water) that could’ve gone elsewhere. The road
to hell is paved with good intentions, etc. But, the moral weight is in
the act itself, you chose to try to create good, acted on it, and that
choice has value regardless of outcome. A firefighter who runs into a
building to save someone but finds it empty still did something brave.
If literally nothing happens, seed dies immediately, no one even notices
you tried, then there’s no consequence and barely any action. You had a
nice thought and made a symbolic gesture. Does symbolic count? If doing
good that results in nothing is morally neutral, then maybe altruism is
only valid when it “works”, which makes it less about the choice to help
and more about getting lucky with outcomes you can’t control. Something
else I didn’t think about, is how wasteful and negligent I would be to
do that, I would be wasting water, and seeds, that someone else could’ve
and should’ve used, because they would know how to care for them, and
they wouldn’t be banking it all on the morals of some stranger. The
water used to establish a young tree is negligible. You’re not diverting
irrigation from drought-stricken crops. The “someone else could use this
better” argument only has teeth when resources are genuinely scarce and
alternative uses are clearly superior. Take your own meaning from this.
Apply your own beliefs, your own mind, who you are as a person, which
happens naturally as you read, and you’ll come out with a meaning that
is biased, some might even say incorrect and you’ll get your own
understanding of my script. But, in the end, does any of this
matter?</p>

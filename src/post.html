<h1 id="rivals">Rivals</h1>
<p>Need For Speed: Rivals. What a game. Just kidding, I hate it.</p>
<p>And I’m not going to talk much about the gameplay or anything like
that. No, I want to focus my attention on the PS3 port of the game.</p>
<p>Rivals is a PS4 and Xbox One game. For some reason it got a port to
PS3 and Xbox 360. I can’t speak for the Xbox 360 port as I don’t own an
Xbox 360, but I seriously doubt it would be too different.</p>
<h1 id="the-problem">The Problem</h1>
<p>The gameplay is no different from the PS4 and Xbox One versions (for
better and for worse). But the game doesn’t <em>feel</em> right.
Everything about it is off:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edges are blurry</li>
<li>It really loves its overbright sun and lighting</li>
<li>The distance looks weirdly foggy</li>
<li>It tends to crash the system a lot</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t think this is the fault of the PS3. I blame Criterion and
Ghost.</p>
<p>And I also think it’s kinda weird since Criterion made both Burnout
Paradise (which truly is a bundle of joy and a great showcase of the
PS3’s ability, and in fact it has a ton of similarities to Rivals. Hmm.)
and Need For Speed: Most Wanted (2012).</p>
<p>People like comparing it to Burnout Paradise and that is true because
it’s basically a more generic and less fun Burnout Paradise, except I’d
say it’s more graphically advanced than Burnout Paradise (not to say
Paradise looks bad!).</p>
<h2 id="what-the-ps3-could-actually-do">What the PS3 Could Actually
Do</h2>
<p>Some younger viewers may want to cover their eyes. I’m going to say
what’s considered a bit of a slur in the PS3 community: The Last Of
Us.</p>
<p>Yes, I know. It was a rare occasion and stroke of luck and it was so
late to the PS3 so everything was figured out. But it does show what is
ballpark possible. And it puts Rivals to even more shame.</p>
<p>Another worthy mention is Need For Speed: Undercover. The game
suffers from 2000s syndrome—a piss filter, questionable lighting, and
everything in between. But it <em>works</em>.</p>
<p>All three of those games feel like a PS3 game. They feel like they’re
taking full advantage of the PS3. And they feel good. Modern, even.</p>
<p>Need For Speed: Rivals is anything but. Once again, the issues of
blurriness, render distance, fogginess, and looking like someone smeared
a rather thick layer of Vaseline over the screen.</p>
<p>This doesn’t feel like a PS3 game. And it isn’t. Not even close. It
doesn’t take full advantage of the incredible Cell Broadband Engine and
Reality Synthesiser.</p>
<p>Look at something like Remember Me too. Wonderful lighting and
honestly it just looks so nice.</p>
<h2 id="what-it-actually-feels-like">What It Actually Feels Like</h2>
<p>Rivals isn’t a PS3 game and it doesn’t feel like it. It feels like
the PS3 is on life support, like it can’t run the game. And sure, it
can’t. The PS4 will always be superior. But that doesn’t mean there
isn’t room for improvement with Rivals. There is <em>so much</em>
room.</p>
<p>It feels like a PS Vita game. Maybe a blend of PSP and PS Vita. The
PS Vita could run full console games (see Need For Speed: Most Wanted
(2012)’s Vita port). But it can only run it with major hindrances. Just
like the ones in Rivals.</p>
<h2 id="the-verdict">The Verdict</h2>
<p>I don’t fully blame nor excuse them for this—it was always going to
be primarily for the newer consoles. Honestly, I think EA forced them to
make ports for the eighth generation consoles.</p>
<p>Rather unsatisfying of an ending. I don’t have any resolution. Any
sudden fact that makes it all right.</p>
<p>It’s just a really bad cross-generation game.</p>
<p>Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.</p>

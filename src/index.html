                    We all know fridges preserve food. But why do we need <i>giant</i> ones? On car-dependent sprawl, the feedback loop that trapped us, bulk buying we can't escape, and how we're stuck with humming boxes because we designed cities wrong 70 years ago.

                    The ideas are appealing, but can it actually work at the scale of a nation? On the information problem, tragic trade-offs during scarcity, human nature, and why every economic system sucks, just in different ways.

          <div class="scroll-text">Oh, it's a windy and sunny day... And I can hear the faint sound of distant waves... The past weeks have gone by so fast... It's all the same: the bright sky and shining sun... I have a feeling it's gonna be a fun day... Oh, it's a windy and sunny day... Though many summers have many grey against... Guess it's another trouble free day... Our playground's so huge, we don't know where it ends... Feels energetic and groovy... Everything's good, it's excellent... Every day's a new beginning, yeah... We don't know who we're gonna meet today... More I want, the less that I can get... Keep walking for a new tomorrow... But I guess that I'm so happy now... Gonna set my heart free... Now I've got nothing to worry me... Come on, let's just get up, go, go, go, go... Hey, big guy, hey, little guy... Can you tell me who came first?... Sorry, but I don't know... We are simply natural... Okay, all you have to do is sit up, look left, right, up and down... Hey, big guy, hey, little guy... Can you tell me what's inside?... Sorry, but I don't know... We are simply natural... We present you with a gift, welcome to our paradise... Hey, hey, come on... Oh, yeah... What do you think about the incident?... You always take me for granted... I am asking you as a first step... You answer first 'cause I asked you first... You and I are friends for all of time... Tell me how you feel... But you know I can't resist that smiley face... Happy, happy, muy amable... Hey, big guy, hey, little guy... Can you tell me who came first?... Sorry, but I don't know... We are simply natural... Okay, all you have to do is sit up, look left, right, up and down... Hey, big guy, hey, little guy... Can you tell me what's inside?... Sorry, but I don't know... We are simply natural... We present you with a gift, welcome to our special paradise... When it all comes down to just one little thing, love... Yeah, yeah, woo</div>

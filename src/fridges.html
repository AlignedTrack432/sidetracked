        <h1 id="why-do-we-need-giant-fridges">Why do we need giant fridges?</h1>
<h1 id="the-question">The Question</h1>
<p>I was recently thinking about refrigerators. Why do we need them? I
mean, I know the technical reason, food preservation, but why do we need
giant fridges specifically? It’s more interesting than you think.</p>
<p>I’ll preface this with the fact that I’m mainly talking about car
dependent countries.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be better to just buy what you need? And does this tie
into the lack of walkable cities?</p>
<h1 id="the-problem">The Problem</h1>
<p>Over time, due to capitalism wanting more and more out of workers,
and the slow privatization of many governments, eventually, walkable
cities became that thing that everybody wants but nobody has. Except
Europeans, because of course. So we starting investing less and less
into actually making life nice, and more, in, whatever. Highways.
Suburban sprawl. Corporate profits. Not taxing properly. Not investing
enough in public works.</p>
<p>Actual citizen comfort seems to be on the back burner. Cities became
more and more crowded. Clear separation between residential and
commercial areas. It means that you can’t just walk to the grocery store
anymore. It’s too far. Especially daily. Even driving sucks. Some
neighborhoods don’t have any nearby grocery stores, walkable or not.</p>
<p>Which means, you can’t just only buy for today or the next day, and
use what you need. Even if close enough, most of our grocery stores
aren’t designed for “pop in for tonight’s dinner” shopping. Mainly
because sizes are too big. You are not going to go through 4 tomatoes in
one day. If you are, you scare me.</p>
<p>And, work schedules don’t allow for daily market trips. If you work a
9 to 5, nearly every decent grocery store will be out of stock of the
most desirable items or closed by the time you get off work, fight
traffic, and arrive. Not to mention, cooking food is already time
consuming. Going to buy food on top? And how far the average grocery
store will be? Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Food distribution systems assume weekly bulk buying. Like I said,
you’re not going through 4 tomatoes in 1 day. 4 is the smallest I’ve
ever seen, not including loose tomatoes. Oil, rice, eggs, butter,
margarine, peanut butter, jam, bread. Even the small 500g bags of rice,
that’s 3 meals for a family of 4. Imagine a single person. Chicken
breasts, mince (although to a lower degree), etc. These are made for
weekly buying.</p>
<p>So the fridge becomes needed infrastructure to compensate for
car-dependent sprawl. In walkable cities with neighborhood markets,
people in many countries, do exactly what I describe, buy fresh food for
that day or next day, keep smaller fridges (or just the freezer
compartment), less waste. We buy bulk because it’s cheaper per unit, but
then waste half of it, so we didn’t actually save money. Plus the mental
load of “what am I going to do with these 4 tomatoes?”. 12 is more
common, actually, which is even worse!</p>
<p>There is also a feedback loop, and it goes something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Car infrastructure</li>
<li>Distant stores</li>
<li>Need cars</li>
<li>Need big fridges</li>
<li>Buy in bulk</li>
<li>Need cars</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, we are trapped. Each element reinforces another, and
unless every one is broken at once, it’s hard to change anything</p>
<p>This also leads to food waste. Instead of buying when we need, we buy
in advance. When we inevitably don’t consume all of what we bought, or
none at all, well, the result is obvious.</p>
<p>Maybe the culture of individualism enabled the car-dependent sprawl
in the first place (everyone wants their own house with yard, screw
public transit, etc.), which then required the big fridges as
infrastructure compensation.</p>
<p>Who can afford daily shopping trips? As I mentioned, a 9 to 5 ain’t
all too friendly. And, it shouldn’t be more expensive, but it is. Mainly
because of cars, and things are cheaper in bulk. To buy daily and fresh
needs time, energy after work, proximity to stores, and ability to carry
smaller loads. A privilege in car dependent areas. But bulk buying need:
upfront capital, storage space, reliable transportation, a big fridge,
they both lock out different groups</p>
<p>There’s also something to be said about the energy usage of running
huge fridges 24/7 vs more frequent trips. In my opinion, in a walkable
city, if you don’t take your car, it is way better to buy
frequently.</p>
<h1 id="how-did-we-get-here">How did we get here?</h1>
<p><strong>1920s-1940s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Car ownership exploded after Ford’s assembly line made cars
affordable</li>
<li>Cities began widening streets and adding parking</li>
<li>Early zoning laws started separating residential from commercial
areas</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1950s-1960s:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The Interstate Highway System (1956) fundamentally restructured
cities, often bulldozing urban neighborhoods to make way for
highways</li>
<li>Massive suburban expansion was fueled by FHA loans that favored new
suburban homes over urban housing</li>
<li>Single-use zoning became standard, separating homes, shops, and
workplaces by law</li>
<li>Shopping malls emerged as the new commercial centers, designed
exclusively for car access</li>
<li>Refrigerators and freezers became standard, eliminating the need for
daily shopping (oh hey)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1970s-???:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Parking minimums were codified (requiring businesses to build huge
parking lots)</li>
<li>Suburban sprawl continued as the default development pattern</li>
<li>Public transit systems were often dismantled or severely
reduced</li>
</ul>
<p>The system older generations had milkmen, daily bakery visits, corner
stores, walking to the butcher, required density and mixed-use
neighborhoods. Once zoning separated everything and suburban development
spread homes far apart, those businesses couldn’t survive. The
infrastructure literally made walkable patterns illegal in most new
development.</p>
<p>European cities largely avoided this because many rebuilt after WWII
with different priorities, maintaining density and investing in public
transit rather than highways through city centers.</p>
<h1 id="what-next">What next?</h1>
<p>There’s no individual solution (we’re trapped in infrastructure).
Maybe, if policies were introduced to blend commercial and residential
areas more, this could work better.</p>
<p>But lets be honest with ourselves. This will probably never
happen.</p>
<p>So yeah, we’re stuck with giant humming boxes in our kitchens because
we designed cities wrong 70 years ago. Cool. No pun intended</p>
